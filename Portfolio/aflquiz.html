    <h2>üß† Project Overview</h2>
    <p> The Multi-Sport Quiz Game is a Java Swing application that provides an interactive quiz experience across multiple sports categories including AFL, Basketball, Tennis, Soccer, American Football, and NRL. The aim of the project was to develop an engaging and educational tool while enhancing my skills in GUI development and user interaction handling in Java.
    </p>

    <h2>üîß How It Works</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>‚Ä¢ Upon launching, users are greeted with a sleek topic selection menu.</li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ Each topic button leads to a quiz consisting of 5 multiple-choice questions.</li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ Questions are displayed one at a time, and users select their answer by clicking a button.</li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ The system keeps track of correct answers and displays the final score at the end.</li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ A ‚ÄúPlay Again‚Äù or ‚ÄúHome‚Äù option allows users to restart or choose a different sport.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üí° Why This Project? </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>‚Ä¢ To apply and strengthen my Java Swing GUI development skills. </li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ To implement modular code logic using object-oriented principles. </li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ To enhance user experience design through color themes, layout control, and responsive components. </li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ To build an expandable application framework where more sports and questions can be added with ease. </li>
    </ul>
