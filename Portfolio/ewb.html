    <h2>üß† Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This project was part of the Engineers Without Borders (EWB) Challenge 2023, which aimed to develop sustainable solutions for the Dawul Wuru Aboriginal Corporation. Our group designed a solar-powered trailer that delivers clean, reliable, and transportable energy to remote Yirrganydji community sites in Far North Queensland. The project emphasized cultural sensitivity, sustainability, and real-world engineering application.</p>
  
    <h2>üîß How It Works</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>‚Ä¢ The trailer is equipped with solar panels mounted on a metal chassis, supported by off-road tires for rural terrain.</li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ Solar energy is captured and stored in onboard batteries, providing consistent power throughout the day and night.</li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ The design is modular and compact, allowing it to be easily transported using vehicles with tow bars.</li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ The panels can fold down for mobility and tilt at an angle to maximize sun exposure during use.</li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ The system is intended for individual ownership and can be deployed in various Dawul Wuru community locations.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>üí° Why This Project?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>‚Ä¢ To address the need for clean, scalable, and mobile energy in communities with short land tenures.</li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ To design an energy solution that respects cultural values and minimizes environmental impact.</li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ To apply engineering skills in prototyping, community consultation, and sustainable design thinking.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>üîç Design Process</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>‚Ä¢ We explored multiple renewable options including wind, hydro, ocean, geothermal, and solar energy.</li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ A decision matrix was used to assess seasonality, transportability, cost, and environmental impact.</li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ Solar was selected for its affordability, low maintenance, and high compatibility with the local climate.</li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ A 3D printed prototype was created to test structure, scale, and mobility features.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>üì¶ Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>‚Ä¢ 9x5 ft trailer with collapsible, angle-adjustable solar panels.</li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ Durable off-road wheels suitable for rural and wet terrain.</li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ Onboard battery storage for continuous energy supply.</li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ Designed to be low-maintenance and long-lasting (10+ years).</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>üå± Community Impact</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>‚Ä¢ Provides clean, independent energy to remote Dawul Wuru sites.</li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ Enhances quality of life by supporting lighting, education, and healthcare access.</li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ Reduces environmental damage and supports cultural connection to land and sea.</li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ Offers long-term cost savings and promotes community self-sufficiency.</li>
    </ul>
