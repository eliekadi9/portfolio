    <h2>üß† Project Overview</h2>
    <p> This Slot Machine game was built using Java Swing, a GUI toolkit for developing interactive desktop applications. The aim of the project was to deepen my understanding of event-driven programming, GUI development, and state management in a game setting.
    </p>

    <h2>üîß How It Works</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>‚Ä¢ Players begin by entering a deposit amount.</li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ Clicking ‚ÄúStart Playing‚Äù launches the slot machine interface. </li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ Each play deducts a bet from the balance and spins the reels.</li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ If a winning combination appears, the user receives a payout based on the match. </li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ The game continues until the balance is depleted or the player decides to stop. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üí° Why This Project? </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>‚Ä¢ To practice building responsive, multi-step GUI applications with Java Swing. </li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ To implement randomization, payout logic, and balance management. </li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ To simulate a real-world game scenario involving user input and feedback.</li>
    </ul>
