    <h2>üß† Project Overview</h2>
    <p> This project was a uni subject task. There was a bit of souce code for a basic GUI and basic outline of souce code for the functions, but the predictive text dictionary did not work. To make this work I had to implement two methods called getMostFrequentWordWithPrefix() and readInDictionary() to make this predictive text dictionary functioning. Click the button 'Report' at the bottom of the page to see a written writeup of how these functions work and how they were implemented. 
    </p>

    <h2>üí° Implementations I changed to make this functioning and improve user interaction </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>‚Ä¢ Improved different methods of code to make this predictive text dictionary functioning </li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ Improved the GUI to have a clear text button </li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ Improved the GUI to have a light and dark mode </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üîß How It Works</h2>
<ul>
  <li>‚Ä¢ As the user types, each character triggers a prefix search in the trie.</li>
  <li>‚Ä¢ The trie is searched using Depth-First Search to find the most frequent matching word.</li>
  <li>‚Ä¢ If a suggestion is found, the remaining characters auto-complete the user's word.</li>
  <li>‚Ä¢ The user can press Enter to accept the suggestion or continue typing to refine it.</li>
</ul>
