    <h2>üß† Project Overview</h2>
    <p> Tic Tac Toe game was developed using Java Swing, a GUI toolkit that allows the creation of window-based applications. The goal of this project was to reinforce my understanding of event-driven programming, object-oriented design, and basic game logic. 
    </p>

    <h2>üîß How It Works</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>‚Ä¢ Players alternate turns by clicking on the grid buttons.</li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ The button becomes disabled after a move and displays either an X or O. </li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ The game checks for a win or draw condition after each move using simple logic.</li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ When the game ends, the status bar announces the winner or a draw. </li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ Clicking "Play Again" resets the board and starts a new round. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üí° Why This Project? </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>‚Ä¢ To Practice GUI development in Java with real interaction. </li>
      <li>‚Ä¢Implement core game logic like turn-taking, win detection, and resets. </li>
    </ul>
